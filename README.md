# SFOC-Multimodal_Remote_Sensing_Image_Registration_System
#Such as ENVI, ERDAS and PCI, we develop a multimodal remote sensing image registration system, which can fast and robust realize multimodal remote sensing image matching and registration, but the image must have GeoInformation or RPC File.

#For more detailed usage instructions and related test data, please refer to the PDF file (1-SFOC-The_Instructions_of_Registration_System_for_Use.pdf) in the compressed package.
